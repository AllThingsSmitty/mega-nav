# Mega Nav in CSS

A simple mega nav menu in pure CSS.


### Say Wut?

Mega navs are way cool. Everyone wants one. And now you can have your very own. Also, W3Schools said something about them once, so there's that.


### How'd You Do It?

I used the coolest web technologies to make this happen. Ever heard of [CSS](https://medium.com/cool-code-pal/a-call-for-web-developers-to-deprecate-their-css-1f6430781393)? This mega nav uses top-rated CSS classes for modern features, like colors for background and to change text on hover and stuff.

```css
.mega-menu {
  background: #fff;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  border-radius: 0 0 3px 3px;
  opacity: 0;
  position: absolute;
  transition: all .3s ease .15s;
  visibility: hidden;
  width: 100%;
}
```

And voila...
